*Moment I did not intend to begin the narrative:*

The deer are walking on long slender legs in the moonlit cul de sac.

I decide to let the momentum of my waking commitments head into the house without me.

I will stand there a minute, and chase a fleeting glimpse of my childhood, that eternal time long forgot, spent wandering in nature.

"What if my bourgeouis neighborhood returns to nature?" I wonder to myself.

"Would I really be so upset?"

"Would I really give a f*ck?"

"Or would watching it all descend into a natural habitat be rewarding?"

*The chronological first moment of the story*

The Homeowners Association was the first one to break the news to me.

In one of those glossy fold-over mailers with that tiny circle of adhesive tape holding back the news.

The city of Austin had set aside $75 million to buy up 146 homes in my neighborhood, to "mitigate flooding."

(I'll go back and canvas artifacts to fact check my numbers... memory is so fallible, even in the gifted)

They will tear these homes down.  They have torn down their first.

"WHAT THE F*CK?" I wonder now if I thought to myself?

*That unconnected but now essential speculative conversation with Nick*

While driving to work in the post-dawn morning in my bourgeouis neighborhood, I saw a giant claw, attached to a heavy-duty construction tractor, tearing away the face and foyer of an otherwise Austin-middle-class (aka: expensive) single family home.

"Wow that's interesting." I wonder now if I thought to myself; do I think in words when I observe such scenes in isolation?

Then later on the "LoveSac" teal sofa, both reclined, we discussed this.  Or perhaps Nick was eating in the kitchen?  Or maybe he moved during the course of the conversation?

"Why would they tear down a perfectly good house, when there is a $50k lot for sale right on the same street?" I asked.

"Maybe there was mold inside, and they were required to tear it down?" Nick speculated, intelligently.

I love a valid idea I never considered.

I (want to) believe on the phone later that same night my wife and I talked and she also posited (sp?) a valid theory, new to me.

Maybe...

*Retrospective*

Or maybe this is the same inner nagging voice that always led me to a hot story when I was an aspiring journalist?

Maybe some part of me always new - all along - that 'something was amiss.'

I write that phrase often in my stories and poems:  something is amiss.

Once in life that phrase entered my mind and lingered, and became something of a mantra.

"Why do you do what you do?" So many people have asked in various forms and flavors.

"Because," I ought to begin to say to some quite simply:  "Something is amiss."

With the world.

The order of things.

The 'savage inequality' of everyday life.

The mere fact that the you within you is standing there nodding a head, unsurprisingly.

Unemotionally?

That we no longer have the lust to care about the 'amiss' state of the world is the very reason for alarm!

*Non-sequitor*

"Windows are more expensive than bricks." he said.

"They are!" I exclaimed, after delivering a new stock throwaway line, about how I'm still a radical in wolf's clothing.

*What I had just said*

"If I thought that throwing bricks through windows would make the world a better place faster, that's what I would do."

"But I do what I do because I believe I'll achieve the same goal - of radical social change - at a faster rate." I more or less said.

*End 'What I had just said' segment*

"But if bricks are cheaper than windows..." I wondered to myself... "then it would work as a strategy!" I exclaim aloud.

"We'll bankrupt the bastards!"

(I don't know if I will ever have the courage to admit how flawed I am; someone's wife saying I am in his inner circle, and yet I cannot even immediately recall his name; what's more odd is the fact that I feel the immediate kinship, and don't even feel like I disagree with the wife.  What is a name anyway, but a label (often) assigned to us at birth with exactly 0 evidence of who we are or will become, with some supposed meaning that we are supposed to embrace?)
